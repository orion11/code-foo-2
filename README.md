##This is my Code Foo 2012 Submission

The code is organized around Question 2 (Liquid Layout Webpage) where the solutions for Question 1 and Question 3 are incorporated into it. 

I tried to name the files to be clear which Question they are related to. I will also break it down into sections here:

###Q1 How many ping pong balls to fill a school bus:
- It is interactive on the site.
- Detailed explanation can be found here: /bus-explanation.pdf
- PHP script is in: php/schoolbus.php

###Q2 Create a liquid layout webpage:
- Main pieces: /index.php , /css/style.css , /css/style-1680.css , /script/dynamiclayout.js
- The explanation as to "Why a liquid layout?" is at the top of the index.php file, and i will also copy it here:

Liquid layout is typically used to try to support a variety of screen sizes & resolutions. When fixed width and table layout sites were the norm, most computer monitors were similar sizes. Once large and 16/9 aspect ratio monitors began to enter the market, fixed with sites would have too much whitespace in the margins when viewed full screen. Liquid layout aims to fix that. Lately many sites have been adopting responsive design sites to further improve on issues which were found in purely liquid layouts.

###Q3 License Plate Problem:
- php/license-plate.php

###Bonus Video:
- /intro.mp4
